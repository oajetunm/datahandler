This is a code I wrote where I could not use
any packages to work with data files. To see the questions I attempted to answer,
please see the Question.pdf file in the Data Handling Code file. 
Executing the code will print out the answers. I am proud of this code because I am so used
to depending on packages in python  but having the chance to not use a package and write code
from scratch helped me better understand the theory behind a lot of the packages I use, like pandas.
